# This example shows us the best value that you can put in and get the best
# Ratio of fee to value (fee/value * 10 is the output of point)

# The only confusion I have is when the fees are applied throughout the process.
# I'll probably have to spend a good amount in order to test it and I am not sure if I would like to.
